      "THREEPIO They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!\n",

      "IMPERIAL OFFICER The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.\n",
      "VADER Where are those transmissions you intercepted?\n",
      "REBEL OFFICER We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.\n",
      "VADER If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?\n",
      "VADER Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.  I want her alive!\n",
      "TROOPER There she is! Set for stun!\n",
      "TROOPER She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.\n",
      "THREEPIO Hey, you're not permitted in there.  It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..\n",
      "THREEPIO Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!  Now come out before somebody sees you.\n",
      "THREEPIO Secret mission?  What plans?  What are you talking about?  I'm not getting in there!\n",

      "CAPTAIN Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited.\n",

      "LUKE Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs?\n",
      "LUKE I didn't know you were back!  When did you get in?\n",
      "BIGGS Just now.  I wanted to surprise you, hot shot.  I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working. \n",
      "LUKE The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon?  Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?\n",
      "BIGGS Of course I got it.  Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.  First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.\n",
      "LUKE I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system.  Come and look!\n",
      "DEAK Not again!  Forget it.\n",
      "LUKE There they are!\n",
      "BIGGS That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there!  Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.\n",
      "LUKE But there was a lot of firing earlier...\n",
      "LUKE Hey, easy with those...\n",
      "CAMIE Don't worry about it, Wormie.\n",
      "FIXER I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here.  I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.  Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...\n",
      "LEIA Lord Vader, I should have known.  Only you could be so bold.  The Imperial Senate will not sit stillfor this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...\n",
      "VADER Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.\n",
      "LEIA I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...\n",
      "VADER You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away!\n",
      "COMMANDER Holding her is dangerous.  If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.\n",
      "VADER I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!\n",
      "COMMANDER you anything.\n",
      "VADER Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!\n",
      "SECOND OFFICER Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.\n",
      "VADER She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time.\n",
      "COMMANDER Yes, sir.\n",
      "THREEPIO How did I get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.\n",
      "THREEPIO I've got to rest before I fall apart.  My joints are almost frozen. \n",
      "THREEPIO What a desolate place this is.\n",
      "THREEPIO Where are you going?\n",
      "THREEPIO Well, I'm not going that way.  It's much too rocky.  This way is much easier.\n",
      "THREEPIO What makes you think there are settlements over there?\n",
      "THREEPIO Don't get technical with me.\n",
      "THREEPIO What mission?  What are you talking about?  I've had just about enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!\n",
      "THREEPIO And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.\n",
      "THREEPIO No more adventures.  I'm not going that way.\n",
      "THREEPIO That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.\n",
      "THREEPIO Wait, what's that?  A transport!  I'm saved!\n",
      "THREEPIO Over here!  Help!  Please, help!\n",
      "LUKE ... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic.\n",
      "BIGGS You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.\n",
      "LUKE Look who's talking.  Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...\n",
      "BIGGS I've missed you kid.\n",
      "LUKE Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet.\n",
      "BIGGS Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.\n",
      "LUKE What are you talking about?\n",
      "BIGGS I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...\n",
      "LUKE Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?\n",
      "BIGGS Quiet down will ya!  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!\n",
      "LUKE I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...\n",
      "BIGGS My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.\n",
      "LUKE around forever trying to find them.\n",
      "BIGGS I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...  It's what we always talked about.  Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in. \n",
      "LUKE And I'm stuck here...\n",
      "BIGGS I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.\n",
      "LUKE Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.\n",
      "BIGGS Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.\n",
      "LUKE I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season.  I can't leave him now.\n",
      "BIGGS I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.  What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.\n",
      "LUKE It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.\n",
      "BIGGS Things always change.\n",
      "LUKE I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long? \n",
      "BIGGS No, I'm leaving in the morning...\n",
      "LUKE Then I guess I won't see you.\n",
      "BIGGS Maybe someday...  I'll keep a lookout.\n",
      "LUKE Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...  Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.\n",
      "BIGGS So long, Luke.\n",
      "THREEPIO Artoo-Detoo!  It's you!  It's you!\n",
      "FIRST TROOPER Someone was in the pod.  The tracks go off in this direction. \n",
      "SECOND TROOPER Look, sir - droids.\n",
      "THREEPIO Wake up!  Wake up!\n",
      "THREEPIO We're doomed.\n",
      "THREEPIO Do you think they'll melt us down?\n",
      "THREEPIO Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  Will this never end?\n",
      "BERU Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.\n",
      "LUKE It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.\n",
      "OWEN I have no need for a protocol droid.\n",
      "THREEPIO Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...\n",
      "OWEN What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.\n",
      "THREEPIO Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...\n",
      "OWEN Do you speak Bocce?\n",
      "THREEPIO Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...\n",
      "OWEN All right; shut up! I'll take this one.\n",
      "THREEPIO Shutting up, sir.\n",
      "OWEN Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.\n",
      "LUKE But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...\n",
      "OWEN You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now, come on, get to it!\n",
      "LUKE All right, come on!  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, let's go.\n",
      "LUKE Uncle Owen...\n",
      "OWEN Yeah?\n",
      "LUKE This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look!\n",
      "OWEN Hey, what're you trying to push on us?\n",
      "THREEPIO Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.\n",
      "LUKE Uncle Owen...\n",
      "OWEN Yeah?\n",
      "LUKE What about that one?\n",
      "OWEN What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.\n",
      "LUKE Yeah, take it away.\n",
      "THREEPIO Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition.  I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.\n",
      "LUKE Okay, let's go.\n",
      "THREEPIO Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!\n",
      "THREEPIO Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!\n",
      "LUKE It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!\n",
      "THREEPIO Is there anything I might do to help? \n",
      "LUKE Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!\n",
      "THREEPIO I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.\n",
      "LUKE Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.\n",
      "THREEPIO I see, sir.\n",
      "LUKE Uh, you can call me Luke.\n",
      "THREEPIO I see, sir Luke.\n",
      "LUKE Just Luke.\n",
      "THREEPIO And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.\n",
      "LUKE Hello.\n",
      "LUKE You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.\n",
      "THREEPIO With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.\n",
      "LUKE You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?\n",
      "THREEPIO That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.\n",
      "LUKE Have you been in many battles?\n",
      "THREEPIO Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.\n",
      "LUKE Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...\n",
      "LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You'remy only hope.\n",
      "LUKE What's this?\n",
      "THREEPIO What is what?!?  He asked you a question...What is that?\n",
      "LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.\n",
      "THREEPIO Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind.\n",
      "LUKE Who is she?  She's beautiful.\n",
      "THREEPIO I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.\n",
      "LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...\n",
      "THREEPIO I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...\n",
      "LUKE Is there more to this recording?\n",
      "THREEPIO Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master.\n",
      "THREEPIO He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.\n",
      "LUKE Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?\n",
      "THREEPIO I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?\n",
      "LUKE Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit.\n",
      "LUKE I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.\n",
      "THREEPIO He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.\n",
      "LUKE H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay.\n",
      "LUKE There you go.\n",
      "LUKE Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.\n",
      "THREEPIO been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! \n",
      "AUNT BERU Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!\n",
      "LUKE All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.\n",
      "THREEPIO I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.\n",
      "LUKE Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.\n",
      "THREEPIO Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\n",
      "THREEPIO No, I don't think he likes you at all.\n",
      "THREEPIO No, I don't like you either.\n",
      "LUKE You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.\n",
      "OWEN What makes you think that?\n",
      "LUKE Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n",
      "LUKE I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.\n",
      "OWEN That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.\n",
      "LUKE But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?\n",
      "OWEN He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.\n",
      "LUKE He knew my father?\n",
      "OWEN I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.\n",
      "LUKE Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.\n",
      "OWEN You mean the next semester before harvest?\n",
      "LUKE Sure, there're more than enough droids.\n",
      "OWEN Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season.  This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.\n",
      "OWEN You must understand I need you here, Luke.\n",
      "LUKE But it's a whole 'nother year.\n",
      "OWEN Look, it's only one more season.\n",
      "LUKE Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.\n",
      "AUNT BERU Where are you going?\n",
      "LUKE It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.\n",
      "AUNT BERU Owen, he can't stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him.\n",
      "OWEN I'll make it up to him next year.  I promise.\n",
      "AUNT BERU Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.\n",
      "OWEN That's what I'm afraid of.\n",
      "LUKE What are you doing hiding there?\n",
      "THREEPIO It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.\n",
      "LUKE Oh, no!\n",
      "THREEPIO That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times. \n",
      "LUKE How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!\n",
      "THREEPIO Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?\n",
      "LUKE It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.\n",
      "OWEN Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.\n",
      "LUKE All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it.\n",
      "LUKE You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.\n",
      "THREEPIO Oh, he excels at that, sir.\n",
      "OWEN Luke?  Luke?  Luke?  Where could he be loafing now!\n",
      "OWEN Have you seen Luke this morning?\n",
      "AUNT BERU He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.\n",
      "OWEN Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?\n",
      "AUNT BERU I think so.\n",
      "OWEN Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!\n",
      "LUKE How's that.\n",
      "LUKE Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.\n",
      "THREEPIO Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.\n",
      "LUKE Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...\n",
      "THREEPIO Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...\n",
      "LUKE Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.\n",
      "LUKE Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?\n",
      "THREEPIO Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.\n",
      "LUKE Well, come on. It's getting late.  I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.\n",
      "THREEPIO If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.\n",
      "LUKE No, he's not going to try anything.\n",
      "LUKE What's wrong with him now?\n",
      "THREEPIO Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.\n",
      "LUKE Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's have a look.  Come on.\n",
      "LUKE There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.\n",
      "BEN Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.\n",
      "BEN Don't worry, he'll be all right.\n",
      "LUKE What happened?\n",
      "BEN Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.\n",
      "LUKE Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you! \n",
      "BEN The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?\n",
      "LUKE Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who he's talking about?\n",
      "BEN Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.\n",
      "LUKE I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.\n",
      "BEN Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.\n",
      "LUKE You know him!\n",
      "BEN Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.\n",
      "LUKE Then the droid does belong to you.\n",
      "BEN Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... \n",
      "BEN I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.\n",
      "LUKE ... Threepio!\n",
      "THREEPIO Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...\n",
      "LUKE Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.\n",
      "THREEPIO I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.\n",
      "LUKE No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?\n",
      "BEN Quickly, son... they're on the move.\n",
      "LUKE No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.\n",
      "BEN That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.\n",
      "LUKE You fought in the Clone Wars?\n",
      "BEN Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.\n",
      "LUKE I wish I'd known him.\n",
      "BEN He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me...\n",
      "BEN I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. \n",
      "THREEPIO Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.\n",
      "LUKE Sure, go ahead.\n",
      "LUKE What is it?\n",
      "BEN Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.\n",
      "BEN An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.\n",
      "LUKE How did my father die?\n",
      "BEN A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.\n",
      "LUKE The Force?\n",
      "BEN Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.\n",
      "BEN Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.\n",
      "LUKE I saw part of the message he was...\n",
      "BEN I seem to have found it.\n",
      "LEIA General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.\n",
      "BEN You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.\n",
      "LUKE Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is.\n",
      "BEN I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.\n",
      "LUKE I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.\n",
      "BEN That's your uncle talking.\n",
      "LUKE Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?\n",
      "BEN Learn about the Force, Luke.\n",
      "LUKE Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.\n",
      "BEN You must do what you feel is right, of course.\n",
      "TAGGE Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.\n",
      "MOTTI Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!\n",
      "TAGGE The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....\n",
      "TARKIN The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.  I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.  The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.\n",
      "TAGGE That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?\n",
      "TARKIN The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.\n",
      "TAGGE And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.\n",
      "VADER The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.\n",
      "MOTTI Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!\n",
      "VADER Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.\n",
      "MOTTI Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...\n",
      "VADER I find your lack of faith disturbing.\n",
      "TARKIN Enough of this!  Vader, release him!\n",
      "VADER As you wish.\n",
      "TARKIN This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.\n",
      "LUKE It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.\n",
      "BEN They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.\n",
      "LUKE These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.\n",
      "BEN And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.\n",
      "LUKE Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?\n",
      "LUKE If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!\n",
      "BEN Wait, Luke!  It's too dangerous.\n",
      "LUKE Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!\n",
      "VADER And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.\n",
      "BEN There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.  You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.\n",
      "LUKE I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.\n",
      "BEN Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.\n",
      "TROOPER How long have you had these droids?\n",
      "LUKE About three or four seasons.\n",
      "BEN They're for sale if you want them.\n",
      "TROOPER Let me see your identification.\n",
      "BEN You don't need to see his identification.\n",
      "TROOPER We don't need to see his identification.\n",
      "BEN looking for.\n",
      "TROOPER These are not the droids we're looking for.\n",
      "BEN He can go about his business.\n",
      "TROOPER You can go about your business.\n",
      "BEN Move along.\n",
      "TROOPER Move along.  Move along.\n",
      "THREEPIO I can't abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.\n",
      "LUKE Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.\n",
      "BEN The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.\n",
      "LUKE Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?\n",
      "BEN Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.\n",
      "LUKE I'm ready for anything.\n",
      "THREEPIO Come along, Artoo.\n",
      "BARTENDER We don't serve their kind here!\n",
      "LUKE What?\n",
      "BARTENDER Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.\n",
      "LUKE Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.\n",
      "THREEPIO I heartily agree with you sir.\n",
      "CREATURE Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?\n",
      "HUMAN He doesn't like you.\n",
      "LUKE I'm sorry.\n",
      "HUMAN I don't like you either\n",
      "HUMAN Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.\n",
      "LUKE I'll be careful than.\n",
      "HUMAN You'll be dead.\n",
      "BEN This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...\n",
      "BARTENDER No blasters!  No blaster!\n",
      "BEN This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.\n",
      "THREEPIO I don't like the look of this.\n",
      "HAN Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.\n",
      "BEN Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.\n",
      "HAN Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?\n",
      "BEN Should I have?\n",
      "HAN It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!\n",
      "HAN I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?\n",
      "BEN Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.\n",
      "HAN What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?\n",
      "BEN Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.\n",
      "HAN Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.\n",
      "LUKE Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!\n",
      "HAN But who's going to fly it, kid!  You?\n",
      "LUKE You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...\n",
      "BEN We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.\n",
      "HAN Seventeen, huh!\n",
      "HAN Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.\n",
      "BEN Ninety-four.\n",
      "HAN Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.\n",
      "TROOPER All right, we'll check it out.\n",
      "HAN Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.\n",
      "BEN You'll have to sell your speeder.\n",
      "LUKE That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.\n",
      "GREEDO Going somewhere, Solo?\n",
      "HAN Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.\n",
      "GREEDO It's too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance.  Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.  I'm lucky I found you first.\n",
      "HAN Yeah, but this time I got the money.\n",
      "GREEDO If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.\n",
      "HAN I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...\n",
      "GREEDO Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.\n",
      "HAN Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?\n",
      "GREEDO You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.\n",
      "HAN Over my dead body.\n",
      "GREEDO That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.\n",
      "HAN Yes, I'll bet you have.\n",
      "HAN Sorry about the mess.\n",
      "VADER Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.\n",
      "IMPERIAL OFFICER The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?\n",
      "TARKIN Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.\n",
      "VADER What do you mean?\n",
      "TARKIN I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.\n",
      "TROOPER With pleasure.\n",
      "THREEPIO Lock the door, Artoo.\n",
      "TROOPER All right, check that side of the street.  It's secure.  Move on to the next door.\n",
      "THREEPIO I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.\n",
      "THREEPIO You watch your language!\n",
      "LUKE He says it's the best he can do.  Since the XP-38 came out, they \n",
      "BEN It will be enough.\n",
      "BEN If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.\n",
      "JABBA Come on out, Solo!\n",
      "HAN I've been waiting for you, Jabba.\n",
      "JABBA I expected you would be.\n",
      "HAN I'm not the type to run.\n",
      "JABBA Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.\n",
      "HAN You sent Greedo to blast me.\n",
      "JABBA Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.\n",
      "HAN I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.\n",
      "JABBA Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.\n",
      "HAN You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.\n",
      "JABBA Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.\n",
      "HAN Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.\n",
      "LUKE What a piece of junk.\n",
      "HAN She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.  I've added some special modifications myself.\n",
      "HAN We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.\n",
      "THREEPIO Hello, sir.\n",
      "TROOPER Which way?\n",
      "TROOPER All right, men.  Load your weapons!\n",
      "TROOPER Stop that ship!\n",
      "TROOPER Blast 'em!\n",
      "HAN Chewie, get us out of here!\n",
      "THREEPIO Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.\n",
      "HAN It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.\n",
      "HAN Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.\n",
      "LUKE Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.\n",
      "HAN Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!\n",
      "HAN Here's where the fun begins!\n",
      "BEN How long before you can make the jump to light speed?\n",
      "HAN It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.\n",
      "LUKE Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...\n",
      "HAN Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?\n",
      "LUKE What's that flashing?\n",
      "HAN We're losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.\n",
      "MOTTI We've entered the Alderaan system.\n",
      "LEIA Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.\n",
      "TARKIN Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!\n",
      "LEIA to take the responsibility yourself!\n",
      "TARKIN Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.\n",
      "LEIA The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.\n",
      "TARKIN Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.\n",
      "LEIA No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...\n",
      "TARKIN You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!\n",
      "TARKIN I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?\n",
      "LEIA Dantooine.\n",
      "LEIA They're on Dantooine.\n",
      "TARKIN There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.\n",
      "LEIA What?\n",
      "TARKIN You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. \n",
      "LEIA No!\n",
      "VADER Commence primary ignition.\n",
      "LUKE Are you all right?  What's wrong?\n",
      "BEN I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.\n",
      "BEN You'd better get on with your exercises.\n",
      "HAN Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.\n",
      "HAN Don't everyone thank me at once.\n",
      "HAN Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.\n",
      "THREEPIO Now be careful, Artoo.\n",
      "THREEPIO He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.\n",
      "HAN Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.\n",
      "THREEPIO But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.\n",
      "HAN That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.\n",
      "THREEPIO I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.\n",
      "BEN Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.\n",
      "LUKE You mean it controls your actions?\n",
      "BEN Partially. But it also obeys your commands.\n",
      "HAN Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.\n",
      "LUKE You don't believe in the Force, do you?\n",
      "HAN Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.\n",
      "HAN It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.\n",
      "BEN I suggest you try it again, Luke.\n",
      "BEN This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.\n",
      "LUKE With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?\n",
      "BEN Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them.\n",
      "BEN Stretch out with your feelings.\n",
      "BEN You see, you can do it.\n",
      "HAN I call it luck. \n",
      "BEN In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.\n",
      "HAN Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else.\n",
      "HAN Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.\n",
      "LUKE You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.\n",
      "BEN That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.\n",
      "TARKIN Yes.\n",
      "OFFICER CASS Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.\n",
      "TARKIN She lied!  She lied to us!\n",
      "VADER I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.\n",
      "TARKIN Terminate her... immediately!\n",
      "HAN Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.\n",
      "HAN What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  It's not on any of the charts.\n",
      "LUKE What's going on?\n",
      "HAN Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!\n",
      "LUKE What do you mean?  Where is it?\n",
      "HAN Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.\n",
      "LUKE What?  How?\n",
      "BEN Destroyed... by the Empire!\n",
      "HAN The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...\n",
      "HAN There's another ship coming in.\n",
      "LUKE Maybe they know what happened.\n",
      "BEN It's an Imperial fighter.\n",
      "LUKE It followed us!\n",
      "BEN No.  It's a short range fighter.\n",
      "HAN There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?\n",
      "LUKE It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble.\n",
      "HAN Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.\n",
      "BEN It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.\n",
      "HAN Not for long...\n",
      "BEN A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.\n",
      "LUKE Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...\n",
      "HAN Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.\n",
      "LUKE Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.\n",
      "HAN I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.\n",
      "BEN That's no moon!  It's a space station.\n",
      "HAN It's too big to be a space station.\n",
      "LUKE I have a very bad feeling about this.\n",
      "BEN Turn the ship around!\n",
      "HAN Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.\n",
      "LUKE Why are we still moving towards it?\n",
      "HAN We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!\n",
      "LUKE But there's gotta be something you can do!\n",
      "HAN There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!\n",
      "BEN You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.\n",
      "VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM Clear Bay twenty-three-seven.  We are opening the magnetic field.\n",

      "YODA Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of  the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.\n",
      "LUKE Vader. Is the dark side stronger?\n",
      "YODA No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.\n",
      "LUKE But how am I to know the good side from the bad?\n",
      "YODA You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses  the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.\n",
      "LUKE But tell me why I can't...\n",
      "YODA No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I  teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.\n",
      "LUKE There's something not right here.\n",
      "LUKE I feel cold, death.\n",
      "YODA That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain  of evil it is. In you must go.\n",
      "LUKE What's in there?\n",
      "YODA Only what you take with you.\n",
      "YODA Your weapons...you will not need them.\n",
      "PIETT Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum.\n",
      "FIRST CONTROLLER Yes, sir.\n",
      "PIETT Those Rebels won't escape us.\n",
      "SECOND CONTROLLER Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star  Destroyer Avenger.\n",
      "PIETT Right.\n",
      "VADER ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds  the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations.\n",
      "BOBA FETT As you wish.\n",
      "PIETT Lord Vader! My lord, we have them.\n",
      "THREEPIO Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field.\n",
      "HAN Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!\n",
      "HAN It's not fair!\n",
      "HAN The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!\n",
      "LEIA No light-speed?\n",
      "HAN It's not my fault.\n",
      "THREEPIO Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more  direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.\n",
      "HAN Turn her around.\n",
      "HAN I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front  shield.\n",
      "LEIA You're going to attack them?!\n",
      "THREEPIO Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial  Star Destroyer...\n",
      "LEIA Shut up!\n",
      "NEEDA They're moving to attack position. Shields up!\n",
      "NEEDA Track them,. They may come around for another pass.\n",
      "TRACKING OFFICER Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our  scopes.\n",
      "NEEDA They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking  device.\n",
      "TRACKING OFFICER Well, there's no trace of them, sir.\n",
      "COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the  pursuit.\n",
      "NEEDA Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full  responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.\n",
      "COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER Yes, Captain Needa.\n",
      "YODA Use the Force. Yes...\n",
      "YODA Now...the stone. Feel it.\n",
      "YODA Concentrate!\n",
      "LUKE Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.\n",
      "YODA So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you  nothing that I say?\n",
      "LUKE Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally  different.\n",
      "YODA No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn  what you have learned.\n",
      "LUKE All right, I'll give it a try.\n",
      "YODA No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.\n",
      "LUKE I can't. It's too big.\n",
      "YODA Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm?  Mmmm.\n",
      "YODA And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a  powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we......not this crude matter.  You must feel the Force around you.  Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!\n",
      "LUKE You want the impossible.\n",
      "LUKE I don't...I don't believe it.\n",
      "YODA That is why you fail.\n",
      "VADER Apology accepted, Captain Needa.\n",
      "PIETT Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and  found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.\n",
      "VADER Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along  their last know trajectory.\n",
      "PIETT Yes, my lord. We'll find them.\n",
      "VADER Don't fail me again, Admiral.\n",
      "PIETT Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.\n",
      "THREEPIO Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far.  No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?\n",
      "HAN The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand  by the manual release for the landing claw.\n",
      "THREEPIO I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a  perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...\n",
      "HAN Thank you.\n",
      "LEIA What did you have in mind for your next move?\n",
      "HAN Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump  their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.\n",
      "LEIA With the rest of the garbage. Then what?\n",
      "HAN Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any  ideas?\n",
      "LEIA No. Where are we?\n",
      "HAN The Anoat system.\n",
      "LEIA Anoat system. There's not much there.\n",
      "HAN No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.\n",
      "LEIA Lando system?\n",
      "HAN Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card  player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.\n",
      "LEIA Thanks.\n",
      "HAN Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.\n",
      "LEIA A mining colony?\n",
      "HAN Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go  back a long way, Lando and me.\n",
      "LEIA Can you trust him?\n",
      "HAN No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that.\n",
      "HAN Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!\n",
      "LEIA You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.\n",
      "YODA Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through  the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone.\n",
      "LUKE Han! Leia!\n",
      "YODA Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.\n",
      "LUKE I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.\n",
      "YODA Mmm. Friends you have there.\n",
      "LUKE They were in pain.\n",
      "YODA It is the future you see.\n",
      "LUKE Future? Will they die?\n",
      "YODA Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.\n",
      "LUKE I've got to go to them.\n",
      "YODA Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help  them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.\n",
      "HAN No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying  to reach Lando Calrissian.\n",
      "HAN Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.\n",
      "INTERCOM VOICE You will not deviate from your present course.\n",
      "THREEPIO Rather touchy, aren't they?\n",
      "LEIA I thought you knew this person.\n",

      "INTERCOM VOICE Permission granted to land on Platform  Three-two-seven.\n",
      "HAN Thank you.\n",
      "HAN There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.\n",

      "THREEPIO Oh. No one to meet us.\n",
      "LEIA I don't like this.\n",
      "HAN Well, what would you like?\n",
      "THREEPIO Well, they did let us land.\n",
      "HAN Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.\n",
      "HAN See? My friend.  Keep your eyes open, okay?\n",
      "LANDO Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a  lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled.\n",
      "LANDO How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! I  never thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?\n",
      "THREEPIO Well, he seems very friendly.\n",
      "LEIA Yes...very friendly.\n",
      "LANDO What are you doing here?\n",
      "HAN Ahh...repairs. I thought you could  help me out.\n",
      "LANDO What have you done to my ship?\n",
      "HAN Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.\n",
      "LANDO Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm  the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?\n",
      "LEIA Leia.\n",
      "LANDO Welcome, Leia.\n",
      "HAN All right, all right, you old smoothie.\n",
      "THREEPIO Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My  facilities are at your...\n",
      "THREEPIO Well, really!\n",
      "LANDO What's wrong with the Falcon?\n",
      "HAN Hyperdrive.\n",
      "LANDO I'll get my people to work on it.\n",
      "HAN Good.\n",
      "LANDO You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the  fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.\n",
      "HAN How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?\n",
      "LANDO Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very  self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?\n",
      "HAN You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible  leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?\n",
      "LANDO You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.\n",
      "HAN Yeah.\n",
      "LANDO Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the  price you pay for being successful.\n",
      "THREEPIO Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.\n",
      "SECOND THREEPIO E chu ta!\n",
      "THREEPIO How rude!\n",
      "THREEPIO That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...\n",
      "THREEPIO Hello? How interesting. Oh, my.\n",
      "MAN Who are you?\n",
      "THREEPIO Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No,  no, please don't get up. No!\n",
      "YODA Luke! You must complete the training.\n",
      "LUKE I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've  got to help them.\n",
      "YODA You must not go!\n",
      "LUKE But Han and Leia will die if I don't.\n",
      "BEN You don't know that.\n",
      "BEN Even Yoda cannot see their fate.\n",
      "LUKE But I can help them! I feel the Force!\n",
      "BEN But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when  you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.\n",
      "YODA Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure  at the cave!\n",
      "LUKE But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to  return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.\n",
      "BEN It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your  friends are made to suffer.\n",
      "LUKE And that is why I have to go.\n",
      "BEN Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost  Vader.\n",
      "LUKE You won't.\n",
      "YODA Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi  Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.\n",
      "BEN Patience.\n",
      "LUKE And sacrifice Han and Leia?\n",
      "YODA If you honor what they fight for...yes!\n",
      "BEN If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot  interfere.\n",
      "LUKE I understand.  Artoo, fire up the  converters.\n",
      "BEN Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side.\n",
      "YODA Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.\n",
      "LUKE I will. And I'll return. I promise.\n",
      "YODA Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.\n",
      "BEN That boy is our last hope.\n",
      "YODA No. There is another.\n",
      "HAN The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're  in great shape.\n",
      "LEIA The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen  or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.\n",
      "HAN Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.\n",
      "LEIA I don't trust Lando.\n",
      "HAN Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides,  we'll soon be gone.\n",
      "LEIA And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?\n",
      "LEIA What happened?\n",
      "HAN Where? Found him in a junk pile?\n",
      "LEIA Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?\n",
      "HAN Lando's got people who can fix him.\n",
      "LEIA No, thanks.\n",
      "LANDO I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?\n",
      "LEIA Not really.\n",
      "LANDO You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us  among the clouds.\n",
      "LEIA Thank you.\n",
      "LANDO Will you join me for a little refreshment?\n",
      "LANDO Everyone's invited, of course.\n",
      "LANDO Having trouble with you droid?\n",
      "HAN No. No problem. Why?\n",
      "LANDO So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into  the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire.\n",
      "LEIA So you're part of the mining guild then?\n",
      "LANDO No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be  noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.\n",
      "HAN Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down?\n",
      "LANDO That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.\n",
      "VADER We would be honored if you would join us.\n",
      "LANDO I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.\n",
      "HAN I'm sorry, too.\n",
      "LUKE No, Threepio's with them.\n",
      "LUKE Just hang on. We're almost there.\n",
      "THREEPIO Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take this off! I, uh, don't mean  to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No!\n",
      "THREEPIO Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the  others. Oh, no! I've been shot!\n",
      "LANDO Lord Vader.\n",
      "VADER You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I  have Skywalker.\n",
      "BOBA FETT He's no good to me dead.\n",
      "VADER He will not be permanently damaged.\n",
      "LANDO Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?\n",
      "VADER They must never again leave this city.\n",
      "LANDO That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han  to this bounty hunter!\n",
      "VADER Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.\n",
      "LANDO No.\n",
      "VADER Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison  here.\n",
      "LANDO This deal's getting worse all the time.\n",
      "THREEPIO Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not  right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...\n",
      "HAN I feel terrible.\n",
      "LEIA Why are they doing this?\n",
      "HAN They never even asked me any questions.\n",
      "LEIA Lando.\n",
      "HAN Get out of here, Lando!\n",
      "LANDO Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie  over to me.\n",
      "HAN Over to you?\n",
      "LANDO They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.\n",
      "LEIA What about Han?\n",
      "LANDO Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.\n",
      "LEIA Vader wants us all dead.\n",
      "LANDO He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called  Skywalker.\n",
      "HAN Luke?\n",
      "LANDO Lord Vader has set a trap for him.\n",
      "LEIA And we're the bait.\n",
      "LANDO Well, he's on his way.\n",
      "HAN Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?   My friend!\n",
      "LANDO Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better,  but I have my own problems.\n",
      "HAN Yeah, you're a real hero.\n",
      "LEIA You certainly have a way with people.\n",
      "VADER This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze  Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.\n",
      "IMPERIAL SOLDIER Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class.\n",
      "VADER Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.\n",
      "LANDO Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If  you put him in there, it might kill him.\n",
      "VADER I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on  Captain Solo.\n",
      "THREEPIO If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this  ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.\n",
      "HAN What's going on...buddy?\n",
      "LANDO You're being put into carbon freeze.\n",
      "BOBA FETT What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.\n",
      "VADER The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!\n",
      "THREEPIO Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!\n",
      "HAN Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!\n",
      "THREEPIO Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.\n",
      "HAN Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!\n",
      "HAN Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you  have to take care of her. You hear me?\n",
      "LEIA I love you!\n",
      "HAN I know.\n",
      "THREEPIO What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see.  Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is.\n",
      "VADER Well, Calrissian, did he survive?\n",
      "LANDO Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.\n",
      "VADER He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.\n",
      "IMPERIAL OFFICER Skywalker has just landed, my lord.\n",
      "VADER Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take  the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.\n",
      "LANDO You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.\n",
      "VADER I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.\n",
      "LEIA Luke! Luke, don't -- it's a trap! It's a trap!\n",
      "VADER The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi  yet.\n",
      "LANDO Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it  quiet. Move.\n",
      "LEIA What do you think you're doing?\n",
      "LANDO We're getting out of here.\n",
      "THREEPIO I knew all along it had to be a mistake.\n",
      "LEIA Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust  you?\n",
      "LANDO I had no choice...\n",
      "THREEPIO What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!\n",
      "LEIA Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.\n",
      "LANDO I'm just trying to help...\n",
      "LEIA We don't need any of your help.\n",
      "LANDO H-a-a-a...\n",
      "LEIA What?\n",
      "THREEPIO It sounds like Han.\n",
      "LANDO There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East  Platform...\n",
      "LEIA Chewie.\n",
      "THREEPIO I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all,  he's only a Wookiee.\n",
      "BOBA FETT Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.\n",
      "THREEPIO Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?\n",
      "THREEPIO Turn around, you wooly...!  Hurry, hurry! We're  trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!\n",
      "THREEPIO Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened  to me!\n",
      "THREEPIO Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!\n",
      "VADER You have learned much, young one.\n",
      "LUKE You'll find I'm full of surprises.\n",
      "VADER Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be  true.\n",
      "LUKE No!\n",
      "VADER All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor  thought.\n",
      "VADER Impressive...most impressive.\n",
      "VADER Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear...  now release your anger.\n",
      "VADER Only your hatred can destroy me.\n",
      "LANDO The security codes has been changed!\n",
      "THREEPIO Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security  system.\n",
      "LANDO Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes  control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.\n",
      "LANDO This way.\n",
      "THREEPIO Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know  a power socket from a computer terminal.\n",
      "THREEPIO What are you talking about? We're not interested in the  hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.\n",
      "THREEPIO I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!\n",
      "THREEPIO Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow!\n",
      "LANDO Leia! Go!\n",
      "THREEPIO I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of  course, I've looked better.\n",
      "VADER You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be  destroyed as Obi-Wan did.\n",
      "VADER There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet  realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.\n",
      "LUKE I'll never join you!\n",
      "VADER If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told  you what happened to your father.\n",
      "LUKE He told me enough! He told me you killed him.\n",
      "VADER No. I am your father.\n",
      "LUKE No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!\n",

I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life.  With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.\n",

      "HAN On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?\n",
      "LUKE You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.\n",

      "THREEPIO Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?\n",
      "THREEPIO Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!\n",

      "LUKE I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.\n",
      "HAN No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!\n",
      "LUKE I'll see you back at the fleet.\n",
      "HAN Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?\n",
      "LUKE I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.\n",
      "HAN Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.\n",
      "LANDO Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.\n",
      "LEIA He means \\\n",
      "LANDO Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.\n",
      "LUKE I'll meet you back at the fleet.\n",
      "LEIA Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.\n",
      "LUKE I will.\n",
      "HAN Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.\n",
      "LUKE That's right, Artoo. We're going to the  Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep...  to an old friend.\n",
      "EMPEROR Rise, my friend.\n",
      "VADER The Death Star will be completed on schedule.\n",
      "EMPEROR You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.\n",
      "VADER Yes, my Master.\n",
      "EMPEROR Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.\n",
      "VADER As you wish.\n",
      "EMPEROR Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\n",
      "YODA Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?\n",
      "LUKE No... of course not.\n",
      "YODA I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.  When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?\n",
      "YODA Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.\n",
      "LUKE Master Yoda, you can't die.\n",
      "YODA Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.\n",
      "LUKE But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.\n",
      "YODA No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.\n",
      "LUKE Then I am a Jedi?\n",
      "YODA Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.\n",
      "LUKE Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?\n",
      "YODA Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.\n",
      "LUKE Yoda, I must know.\n",
      "YODA Your father he is.\n",
      "YODA Told you, did he?\n",
      "LUKE Yes.\n",
      "YODA Unexpected this is, and unfortunate..\n",
      "LUKE Unfortunate that I know the truth?\n",
      "YODA No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.\n",
      "LUKE Well, I'm sorry.\n",
      "YODA Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.\n",
      "YODA Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...  There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker.\n",
      "LUKE I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.\n",
      "BEN Yoda will always be with you.\n",
      "LUKE Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?\n",
      "LUKE You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.\n",
      "BEN You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.\n",
      "LUKE A certain point of view!\n",
      "BEN Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.\n",
      "BEN I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault.\n",
      "BEN Anakin was a good friend.\n",
      "BEN When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.\n",
      "LUKE There's still good in him.\n",
      "BEN I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.\n",
      "LUKE I can't do it, Ben.\n",
      "BEN You cannot escape your destiny.\n",
      "LUKE I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.\n",
      "BEN Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.\n",
      "LUKE But I had to help my friends.\n",
      "BEN And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.\n",
      "LUKE I found out Darth Vader was my father.\n",
      "BEN To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!\n",
      "LUKE I can't kill my own father.\n",
      "BEN Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.\n",
      "LUKE Yoda spoke of another.\n",
      "BEN The other he spoke of is your twin sister.\n",
      "LUKE But I have no sister.\n",
      "BEN Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.\n",
      "LUKE Leia! Leia's my sister.\n",
      "BEN Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.\n",
      "BEN When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.\n",
      "BEN The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.\n",
      "LUKE But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.\n",
      "BEN She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!\n",
      "HAN Well, look at you, a general, huh?\n",
      "LANDO Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.\n",
      "HAN Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.\n",
      "LANDO I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.\n",
      "HAN Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?\n",
      "MON MOTHMA The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.\n",
      "MON MOTHMA The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.\n",
      "MON MOTHMA Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.\n",
      "ACKBAR You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.\n",
      "ACKBAR General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack\n",

      "GENERAL MADINE General Solo, is your strike team assembled?\n",
      "HAN Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.\n",

      "HAN Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.\n",
      "LEIA Come on, General, let's move.\n",
      "HAN Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?\n",

      "HAN What are you telling them?\n",
      "THREEPIO Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.\n",
      "HAN Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?\n",
      "THREEPIO I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.\n",
      "HAN Proper?!\n",
      "THREEPIO It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.\n",
      "HAN Why, you--\n",

      "HAN I have a really bad feeling about this.\n",

      "LUKE Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.\n",
      "THREEPIO But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --\n",
      "LUKE Just tell them.\n",
      "THREEPIO You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...\n",
      "THREEPIO ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!\n",
      "THREEPIO Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!\n",

      "THREEPIO Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.\n",
      "HAN Just what I always wanted.\n",
      "HAN Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.  Thank you. Okay.\n",
      "THREEPIO He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.\n",
      "HAN Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back.\n",
      "HAN And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.\n",
      "LUKE Luke, what's wrong?\n",
      "LUKE Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?\n",
      "LEIA Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.\n",
      "LUKE What do you remember?\n",
      "LEIA Just...images, really. Feelings.\n",
      "LUKE Tell me.\n",
      "LEIA She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?\n",
      "LUKE I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.\n",
      "LEIA Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?\n",
      "LUKE Vader is here...now, on this moon.\n",
      "LEIA How do you know?\n",
      "LUKE I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go.  As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.  I have to face him.\n",
      "LEIA Why?\n",
      "LUKE He's my father.\n",
      "LEIA Your father?\n",
      "LUKE There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.\n",
      "LEIA Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.\n",
      "LUKE You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.\n",
      "LUKE Yes. It's you Leia.\n",
      "LEIA I know. Somehow...I've always known.\n",
      "LUKE Then you know why I have to face him.\n",
      "LEIA No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.\n",
      "LUKE No, you don't. You've always been strong.\n",
      "LEIA But, why must you confront him?\n",
      "LUKE Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.\n",
      "HAN Hey, what's goin' on?\n",
      "LEIA Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.\n",
      "HAN Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?\n",
      "LEIA I...I can't tell you.\n",
      "HAN Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?\n",
      "LEIA I...\n",
      "HAN Ahhh...\n",
      "HAN I'm sorry.\n",
      "LEIA Hold me.\n",

      "VADER That name no longer has any meaning for me.\n",
      "LUKE It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.\n",
      "VADER I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.\n",
      "VADER Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.\n",
      "LUKE Come with me.\n",
      "VADER Obi-Wan once thought as you do.\n",
      "VADER You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.\n",
      "LUKE I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.\n",
      "VADER If that is your destiny.\n",
      "LUKE Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.\n",
      "VADER It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.\n",
      "LUKE Then my father is truly dead.\n",
      "LEIA The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.\n",

      "LEIA Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.\n",
      "THREEPIO Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!\n",
      "LANDO Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!\n",
      "WEDGE Red Three, Red Two, pull in!\n",
      "RED TWO Got it!\n",

      "NAVIGATOR Pressure's steady.\n",
      "LANDO Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for.\n",

      "PIETT Hold here.\n",
      "COMMANDER We're not going to attack?\n",
      "PIETT I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.\n",
      "EMPEROR As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station.  Fire at will, Commander.\n",
      "JERJERROD Fire!\n",
      "LANDO That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational!  Home One, this is Gold Leader.\n",
      "ACKBAR We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.\n",
      "LANDO You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.\n",
      "ACKBAR We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.\n",
      "LANDO Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.\n",
      "THREEPIO We're coming!\n",
      "HAN Come on! Come on!\n",
      "THREEPIO Oh, Artoo, hurry!\n",
      "THREEPIO My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?\n",
      "HAN Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.\n",
      "LEIA I'll cover you.\n",
      "LANDO Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point- blank range.\n",
      "ACKBAR At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.\n",
      "LANDO We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.\n",
      "REBEL PILOT She's gonna blow!\n",
      "Y-WING PILOT I'm hit!\n",
      "EMPEROR Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends.\n",
      "EMPEROR Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.\n",
      "WALKER PILOT #1 Look!\n",
      "PILOT #2 Get him off of there!\n",
      "HAN I think I got it. I got it!\n",

      "HAN Let's see.\n",
      "LEIA It's not bad.\n",

      "HAN Stay back.\n",
      "HAN Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.\n",
      "EMPEROR Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through you.\n",
      "VADER Obi-Wan has taught you well.\n",
      "LUKE I will not fight you, father.\n",
      "VADER You are unwise to lower your defenses.\n",
      "LUKE Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.\n",
      "VADER There is no conflict.\n",
      "LUKE You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.\n",
      "VADER You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.\n",
      "EMPEROR Good.  Good.\n",
      "LANDO Watch out. Squad at .06.\n",
      "REBEL PILOT I'm on it, Gold Leader.\n",
      "WEDGE Good shot, Red Two.\n",
      "LANDO Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.\n",
      "HAN/PILOT It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit.\n",
      "CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER Send three squads to help. Open the back door.\n",
      "SECOND COMMANDER Yes, sir.\n",
      "HAN Throw me another charge.\n",
      "VADER You cannot hide forever, Luke.\n",
      "LUKE I will not fight you.\n",
      "VADER Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...\n",
      "VADER Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.\n",
      "LUKE Never-r-r!\n",
      "EMPEROR Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!\n",
      "LUKE Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.\n",
      "EMPEROR So be it...Jedi.\n",
      "HAN Move! Move!\n",
      "ACKBAR The shield is down! Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor.\n",
      "LANDO We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!\n",
      "EMPEROR If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.\n",
      "EMPEROR Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.\n",
      "EMPEROR Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision.\n",
      "LUKE Father, please. Help me.\n",
      "EMPEROR Now, young Skywalker...you will die.\n",
      "WEDGE I'm going in.\n",
      "LANDO Here goes nothing.\n",
      "LANDO Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.\n",
      "WEDGE Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.\n",
      "LANDO Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.\n",
      "PILOT Copy, Gold Leader.\n",
      "LANDO That was too close.\n",
      "ACKBAR We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.\n",

      "LUKE No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.\n",
